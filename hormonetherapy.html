      <h1> Hormone therapy </h1>
      <p> Hormone therapy — perhaps more properly termed hormone-blocking therapy — is often used to treat breast cancers that are sensitive to hormones. Doctors sometimes refer to these cancers as estrogen receptor positive (ER positive) and progesterone receptor positive (PR positive) cancers. </p>
      <p> Hormone therapy can be used after surgery or other treatments to decrease the chance of your cancer returning. If the cancer has already spread, hormone therapy may shrink and control it. </p>
      <h2> Treatments that can be used in hormone therapy include: </h2>
      <p> <b>Medications that block hormones from attaching to cancer cells.</b> Tamoxifen is the most commonly used selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). SERMs act by blocking estrogen from attaching to the estrogen receptor on the cancer cells, slowing the growth of tumors and killing tumor cells. Tamoxifen can be used in both pre- and postmenopausal women. Possible side effects include fatigue, hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness. More significant risks include cataracts, blood clots, stroke and uterine cancer. </p>
      <p> <b>Medications that stop the body from making estrogen after menopause.</b> One group of drugs called aromatase inhibitors blocks the action of an enzyme that converts androgens in the body into estrogen. These drugs are effective only in postmenopausal women. Aromatase inhibitors include anastrozole (Arimidex), letrozole (Femara) and exemestane (Aromasin). Side effects of aromatase inhibitors include joint and muscle pain, as well as an increased risk of bone thinning (osteoporosis). Another drug, fulvestrant (Faslodex), directly blocks estrogen, which keeps tumors from getting the estrogen they need to survive. Fulvestrant is generally used in postmenopausal women for whom other hormone-blocking therapy is not effective or who can't take tamoxifen. Side effects that may occur include fatigue, nausea and hot flashes. Fulvestrant is given by injection once a month. </p>
      <p> <b>Surgery or medications to stop hormone production in the ovaries.</b> In premenopausal women, surgery to remove the ovaries or medications to stop the ovaries from making estrogen can be an effective hormonal treatment. This type of surgery is known as prophylactic oophorectomy and may be called surgical menopause.
